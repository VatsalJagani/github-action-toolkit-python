# github-action-toolkit - Developer README File

### Pypi setup

(Optional) If you plan on publishing your package to PyPI, add repository secrets for `PYPI_USERNAME` and `PYPI_PASSWORD`. To add these, go to "Settings" > "Secrets" > "Actions", and then click "New repository secret".

    *If you don't have PyPI account yet, you can [create one for free](https://pypi.org/account/register/).*


### readthedocs Setup

(Optional) If you want to deploy your API docs to [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org), go to the [readthedocs dashboard](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/import/?) and import your new project.

    Then click on the "Admin" button, navigate to "Automation Rules" in the sidebar, click "Add Rule", and then enter the following fields:

    - **Description:** Publish new versions from tags
    - **Match:** Custom Match
    - **Custom match:** v[vV]
    - **Version:** Tag
    - **Action:** Activate version

    Then hit "Save".

    *After your first release, the docs will automatically be published to [your-project-name.readthedocs.io](https://your-project-name.readthedocs.io/).*


### Creating releases

1. Update the version in `github_action_toolkit/version.py`.

3. Run the release script:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/release.sh
    ```

    This will commit the changes to the CHANGELOG and `version.py` files and then create a new tag in git
    which will trigger a workflow on GitHub Actions that handles the rest.

## Fixing a failed release

If for some reason the GitHub Actions release workflow failed with an error that needs to be fixed, you'll have to delete both the tag and corresponding release from GitHub. After you've pushed a fix, delete the tag from your local clone with

```bash
git tag -l | xargs git tag -d && git fetch -t
```

Then repeat the steps above.
